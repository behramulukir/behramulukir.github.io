<p>Hey,</p>



<p>Sometimes you make some plans; however, life has some other plans. I believe that code refactoring is a canonical event for every developer and for every software package. Sometimes it is a complete overhaul, and sometimes it is just about rewriting a single function, like I did over the last two weeks. Just as I thought I am done with adding the new <em>discrete</em> style to <em>ppc_rootogram</em>, I was -reasonably- told that code I wrote is fairly messy and would be much easier to maintain if I refactor it, split it into two different functions and move data processing to this newly created internal function and change the logic of how visuals are drawn based on the arguments that user passed to the function. It made complete sense, to be honest. I am not going to be around all the time, and if the functionality that I added would create extra problems in the future, that&#8217;s a big issue. Therefore, I got to work and started refactoring the <em>ppc_rootogram</em>, effectively writing it from the ground up.</p>



<p>The issue with <em>ppc_rootogram</em> is that it has three different visual styles that the user can choose from: standing, hanging, suspended, and discrete. Out of these styles, the first three are fairly similar to each other. They use the same visual elements, such as histograms, lines, and filled areas, while the discrete one uses points and point ranges. They also have different shades of the chosen colour used to indicate different things, as well as different labelling and even different values on the y-axis. Especially having different values on the y-axis meant the data preparation for the discrete style is different from that for other styles. In standing, hanging, suspended styles, on the y-axis, the values are plotted with equal intervals, on a square-root scale. On the other hand, discrete style y-axis values are plotted with squared intervals on a square root scale. What I did at the end of the day was create an internal helper function named <em>.ppc_rootogram_data</em> to prepare the different data matrices needed for each style accordingly. This function is placed at the end of the <em>ppc-discrete</em> file and not exported, so it cannot be called by external users. Then, this function is called at the beginning of the <em>ppc_rootogram</em> rootogram to get the correct data matrix. After that, I created an if statement to create different geoms based on the style preference of the user. Then those geoms and other stylistic elements are combined in the final if statement that adds and manipulates the visuality of the graph according to the style that is being followed. This refactoring process made the code much more readable, and it got easier to maintain. It&#8217;ll also be easier to deprecate old styles or add new styles in the future. After doing some final bug fixing, the PR got approval from two reviewers, Teemu and Jonah, and I merged it into the main branch. This also marks the first merge action that I did on bayesplot! You know what, it felt good. I felt like a little kid who is let to play with big brother&#8217;s more complex toys. You can see that work <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/stan-dev/bayesplot/pull/362" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<p>This was not all I did, I am glad to say. I also did some maintenance work. For a long time, it bothered me that there are two different functions, <em>ppc_scatter_error_avg</em> and <em>ppc_scatter_error_avg_vs_x</em>. These functions were doing pretty much the same work, except that the latter had an <em>x</em> argument, which is then plotted on the x-axis, moving the error values to the y-axis. Like I said in the <a target="_blank" href="/gsoc-diaries-6-new-rootogram-style/" rel="noreferrer noopener">last blog post</a>, I was planning to combine these functions, so I went ahead and did that. It was simply checking if anything was passed to the optional <em>x</em> argument, and if yes, doing a few checks and passing it correctly to the helper function, which is doing the actual plotting. This didn&#8217;t take me long to implement; however, I am happy that I ticked another box and moved another task on my project board to <em>the done</em> tab. You can see that work <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/stan-dev/bayesplot/pull/367" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<p>Next week is the final week of Google Summer of Code, so there are only a handful of things that I plan to do. First, I hope to complete the implementation of <em>ppc_residual_scatter</em>. It initially seemed quite complicated to me, but after discussing it with Teemu, we realised that there should be a relatively straightforward way to implement this. If I still have time after doing this, I&#8217;ll pick up some tasks from the open issues and implement them. I also need to write my final report and do my final submission to Google. See you sooner next time!</p>

<p>Hey,</p>



<p>In the <a target="_blank" href="/gsoc-diaries-4-new-arguments-and-error-plots/" rel="noreferrer noopener">last blog post</a>, I talked about the idea of working on residual plots and error plots and my decision to tackle the issue of the lack of an x argument as an optional covariate in the<em> ppc_error_binned</em> function to quickly implement something. The implementation wasn&#8217;t very complicated, and I quickly created a PR about it, which was then merged to the master branch after a small update from one of my mentors and the maintainer of the bayesplot package, Jonah. Apparently, I forgot that there was a new way that we were using to label the x-axis, which I didn&#8217;t follow, so he updated the code to follow the same way, and it was good to go. Honestly, it felt so good that there wasn&#8217;t much work needed on that PR, especially because I was planning to take a week off to travel in the Nordics with my family and some of their friends. As a result of my spending a week wandering around Copenhagen -which I absolutely loved- and Stockholm -which I didn&#8217;t really like that much- I knew I wouldn&#8217;t be able to push any new code, so that PR about <em>ppc_error_binned</em> going through smoothly upped my mood quite a bit.</p>



<p>Getting back to work last Monday after a week off, I wasn&#8217;t sure of what to do next. As I said before, second part of working with residual plots that I mentioned on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/stan-dev/bayesplot/issues/358" rel="noreferrer noopener">my issue</a>, implementing a new plot -possibly- named <em>ppc_residual</em> which would plot <em>y â stat(y_rep)</em> on the y-axis and <em>stat(y_rep)</em> on the x-axis, required careful thinking and planning about how do we want to structure error plots and residual plots so that they make the most sense to users. As this was not something that I could decide on my own, I decided to call a meeting with my mentors Jonah, Aki, and Teemu to discuss this, and then we settled on Thursday as the meeting date.</p>



<p>Since I didn&#8217;t want to sit and do nothing in the meantime, I decided to pick up another task that we put on our GitHub project and turned it into an issue: <a href="https://github.com/stan-dev/bayesplot/issues/360" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Emphasising discreteness of data in rootograms</a>. This was something that SÃ¤ilynoja et al<sup data-fn="6999679c-4d69-499b-96cd-3800b4e85c5b" class="fn"><a href="#6999679c-4d69-499b-96cd-3800b4e85c5b" id="6999679c-4d69-499b-96cd-3800b4e85c5b-link">1</a></sup> proposed in <a href="https://teemusailynoja.github.io/visual-predictive-checks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their preprint</a>, which simply meant adding an alternative look to rootograms so that their discreteness is more explicit than they are at the moment. This, in my opinion, was a fair point to raise because rootograms are designed to visualise discrete data points, while the visual items in rootograms were continuous, such as lines and fields that normally represent continuity. As this issue is separate from the residual plot discussions, it seemed like a nice new avenue for me to pursue while we are deciding on the fate of residual and error plots. Unfortunately, though, it appeared to be more complicated than I thought. Adding a completely new aesthetic option to an existing graph, especially one that is a little complicated, like the proposed rootogram, takes some time to get right. I made some progress; however, at the moment, it is not good enough to create a PR about it. My first goal for the next week is to finish up that implementation quickly so that it can get merged into the main branch soon.</p>



<p>That is not all in this blog post, of course. As I told you, we had a meeting last Thursday to discuss how we want to shape error plots and residual plots and how we should group them. As they have a very similar logic behind them, it doesn&#8217;t make much sense to have different documentation pages for them. At the same time, having many functions on the same page will also lead to cluttered documentation and confuse users. Therefore, we decided to start with a fresh, blank page. We wanted to gather all functionalities that we want to have regarding error and residual plots, and then go forward. So, I created <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/stan-dev/bayesplot/issues/361" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new issue</a> to gather our and community members&#8217; ideas about these types of plots. Then, we will see which of those desired functionalities we already have implementations for and which of those need new implementations. Then, we will transfer everything to a new documentation page and make a fresh start for error and residual plots. Of course, this will take quite some time and certainly will extend beyond my GSoC time; however, I am happy that we are taking steps forward, and I&#8217;m glad that I&#8217;m a part of this journey. I would like to stay around and contribute when we do those transitions, but for now, I have to focus on other things as part of the programme. What are those going to be except rootograms? You will hear in the next blog post!</p>

<p>Hey,</p>



<p>In the <a target="_blank" href="/gsoc-diaries-3-first-pr/" rel="noreferrer noopener">last blog post</a>, I talked about quantile dot plots and doing my first official PR on the repository. Since then, that PR required a few updates and took me a couple of more days to finalise. One of my favourite things about GSoC is how much I learn about software development that I wouldn&#8217;t learn if it weren&#8217;t an open-source focused programme. For example, a small but very important thing I missed while doing my first PR was compiling the documentation. I thought writing up the documentation would be enough, but apparently, I needed to compile it explicitly so that it actually shows up on the website. After getting feedback from my mentors to fix such little mistakes, I managed to finish up the PR, and since it has been merged to the main branch, I am waiting to be included in the next release of the package. Congratulations to me, I guess!</p>



<p>As there are lots of things to implement as part of my project, I quickly started working on my next task. This time, I wanted to focus on another part of the bayesplot error/residual plots. In their paper, SÃ¤ilynoja et al<sup data-fn="ce849c50-92d7-400c-bd10-1e20a0019884" class="fn"><a href="#ce849c50-92d7-400c-bd10-1e20a0019884" id="ce849c50-92d7-400c-bd10-1e20a0019884-link">1</a></sup> highlighted the importance of residual plots that are robust in visualising both continuous and discrete data. So far, error plots in bayesplot are geared towards handling continuous data, which created a need for changes.</p>



<p>There have been already talks about error plots and whether we need alternative approaches for them, so I created <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/stan-dev/bayesplot/issues/358" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new issue</a> to discuss those things, gathering two important tasks to implement: first, adding an optional <em>x</em> argument to <em>ppc_error_binned</em> function and second, implementing a new plot -possibly- named <em>ppc_residual</em> which would plot <em>y &#8211; stat(y_rep)</em> on the y-axis and <em>stat(y_rep)</em> on the x-axis. Currently, <em>ppc_error_*</em> functions are plotting stat(<em>y &#8211; y_rep)</em> on the y-axis and <em>stat(y_rep)</em> on the x-axis. Our discussion led us to think that implementing the second task requires detailed thinking, especially regarding how we want to structure the package. For example, it is an important question whether we want to create a new family of functions for <em>ppc_residual_*</em> or include them in the <em>ppc_error_*</em> family. Since we haven&#8217;t settled on this discussion, I decided to start working on something that I can implement right away: adding an optional <em>x</em> argument to <em>the ppc_error_binned</em> function.</p>



<p>To be honest, this task has been fairly easier than implementing a whole new function from scratch. As there are already helper functions to use, the task for me is just to change a handful of lines, update the documentation, and implement new tests to make sure the new abilities of the function work as intended. Though the most important part of this task was not breaking anything, because in a package that has quite a lot of users, the last thing you would want is messing with functions that people might be utilising in production code.</p>



<p>With a quick implementation phase, I managed to finish up the changes that were needed and created a <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/stan-dev/bayesplot/pull/359" rel="noreferrer noopener">new PR</a> for them. This new code is passing all the tests, not breaking any existing code, and implementing the changes we needed just as described. Hopefully, this PR will quickly make its way to the main branch. I am quite happy with ramping up my shipping speed, and I hope to keep this up. I still haven&#8217;t settled on what I should implement next, but let&#8217;s keep it as a mystery for the next diary entry!</p>
