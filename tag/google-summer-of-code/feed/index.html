<p>Hey,</p>



<p>Sometimes you make some plans; however, life has some other plans. I believe that code refactoring is a canonical event for every developer and for every software package. Sometimes it is a complete overhaul, and sometimes it is just about rewriting a single function, like I did over the last two weeks. Just as I thought I am done with adding the new <em>discrete</em> style to <em>ppc_rootogram</em>, I was -reasonably- told that code I wrote is fairly messy and would be much easier to maintain if I refactor it, split it into two different functions and move data processing to this newly created internal function and change the logic of how visuals are drawn based on the arguments that user passed to the function. It made complete sense, to be honest. I am not going to be around all the time, and if the functionality that I added would create extra problems in the future, that&#8217;s a big issue. Therefore, I got to work and started refactoring the <em>ppc_rootogram</em>, effectively writing it from the ground up.</p>



<p>The issue with <em>ppc_rootogram</em> is that it has three different visual styles that the user can choose from: standing, hanging, suspended, and discrete. Out of these styles, the first three are fairly similar to each other. They use the same visual elements, such as histograms, lines, and filled areas, while the discrete one uses points and point ranges. They also have different shades of the chosen colour used to indicate different things, as well as different labelling and even different values on the y-axis. Especially having different values on the y-axis meant the data preparation for the discrete style is different from that for other styles. In standing, hanging, suspended styles, on the y-axis, the values are plotted with equal intervals, on a square-root scale. On the other hand, discrete style y-axis values are plotted with squared intervals on a square root scale. What I did at the end of the day was create an internal helper function named <em>.ppc_rootogram_data</em> to prepare the different data matrices needed for each style accordingly. This function is placed at the end of the <em>ppc-discrete</em> file and not exported, so it cannot be called by external users. Then, this function is called at the beginning of the <em>ppc_rootogram</em> rootogram to get the correct data matrix. After that, I created an if statement to create different geoms based on the style preference of the user. Then those geoms and other stylistic elements are combined in the final if statement that adds and manipulates the visuality of the graph according to the style that is being followed. This refactoring process made the code much more readable, and it got easier to maintain. It&#8217;ll also be easier to deprecate old styles or add new styles in the future. After doing some final bug fixing, the PR got approval from two reviewers, Teemu and Jonah, and I merged it into the main branch. This also marks the first merge action that I did on bayesplot! You know what, it felt good. I felt like a little kid who is let to play with big brother&#8217;s more complex toys. You can see that work <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/stan-dev/bayesplot/pull/362" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<p>This was not all I did, I am glad to say. I also did some maintenance work. For a long time, it bothered me that there are two different functions, <em>ppc_scatter_error_avg</em> and <em>ppc_scatter_error_avg_vs_x</em>. These functions were doing pretty much the same work, except that the latter had an <em>x</em> argument, which is then plotted on the x-axis, moving the error values to the y-axis. Like I said in the <a target="_blank" href="/gsoc-diaries-6-new-rootogram-style/" rel="noreferrer noopener">last blog post</a>, I was planning to combine these functions, so I went ahead and did that. It was simply checking if anything was passed to the optional <em>x</em> argument, and if yes, doing a few checks and passing it correctly to the helper function, which is doing the actual plotting. This didn&#8217;t take me long to implement; however, I am happy that I ticked another box and moved another task on my project board to <em>the done</em> tab. You can see that work <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/stan-dev/bayesplot/pull/367" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<p>Next week is the final week of Google Summer of Code, so there are only a handful of things that I plan to do. First, I hope to complete the implementation of <em>ppc_residual_scatter</em>. It initially seemed quite complicated to me, but after discussing it with Teemu, we realised that there should be a relatively straightforward way to implement this. If I still have time after doing this, I&#8217;ll pick up some tasks from the open issues and implement them. I also need to write my final report and do my final submission to Google. See you sooner next time!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Hey,</p>



<p>In my <a href="https://behramulukir.github.io/?page_id=745" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last blog post</a>, I talked about rootograms and the new rootogram style that is proposed by Säilynoja et al<sup data-fn="4ddca5b5-4230-4374-bfe7-4677c12fd70f" class="fn"><a href="#4ddca5b5-4230-4374-bfe7-4677c12fd70f" id="4ddca5b5-4230-4374-bfe7-4677c12fd70f-link">1</a></sup>. This new rootogram style puts more emphasis on the discrete nature of count data compared to other rootogram styles. It does this by using discrete visual elements such as point ranges and points instead of lines and filled areas. It also visually looks good and is very compatible with the general plot style followed in bayesplot. In the past two weeks, I have managed to take this idea to a complete implementation and finalised my PR about it, as I promised myself in the last blog post: <a href="https://github.com/stan-dev/bayesplot/pull/362" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adding a discrete option to ppc_rootogram</a>.</p>



<p>The last two weeks were very hectic for me, mainly due to my personal life but also partly because this discrete rootogram required more in-depth thinking than I anticipated. To begin with, I had to travel to Turkey for a couple of days for an Australian visa application, which unfortunately cannot be filled out in Finland, mostly because Finnish people are not required to get a visa to travel to Australia. That made me travel to Turkey for a visa appointment that took only an hour or so. Since I didn&#8217;t want to stop working, I tried to work on my way there, at the airport, while staying at my family&#8217;s house, and so on. Naturally, these weren&#8217;t the most efficient and productive working hours. I am not even mentioning the very deep pain that I had in my right leg that made me unable to sleep, which is now getting better after I had a doctor&#8217;s appointment, received exercise instructions to follow and some medication to take. As a combined result of all these things, I wasn&#8217;t very productive, but I am glad that I managed to complete rootograms and made them ready to be merged to the main branch.</p>



<p>Like I said, the hectic part was mostly about my personal life, but it was also partly related to the rootograms. It turned out that to correctly add a discrete style to a rootogram, there were lots of minor things I needed to consider. For example, in the version proposed in the articles, Teemu opted to use colours as indicators of whether observations lay within the bounds of posterior samples. This is a good idea, which looks nice visually, but it is not compatible with bayesplot. In bayesplot, users are free to pick from colour schemes whose different shades are used to colour different visual elements of the plot. That made having two completely different colours for such a distinction impossible. I also didn&#8217;t consider different shades of the same colour to be easy enough to tell apart from each other to be used in such a context. Therefore, we decided to move on with using different shapes as our indicators. Then came the question of which shapes to use. After long discussions, I settled on using squares for within bounds and rhombuses for out-of-bounds points. That being said, I also implemented a new argument called <em>bound_distinct</em>, which is set to true by default and used to control whether the user wants such an indication of within/out of bound points based on the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/stan-dev/bayesplot/pull/362#issuecomment-3143677841" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggestion of Osvaldo A. Martin</a>. When <em>bound_distinct</em> is set to false, all observation points are visualised by squares. This was not the only point of discussion, though. Like I said, in bayesplot, users pick a colour scheme which is then used to colour the plot accordingly. However, it is not always crystal clear how to assign different shades to different parts of the plot. In other rootogram styles, lighter shades are used for observed points while darker shades are used for sampled points. This convention, in my opinion, didn&#8217;t make much sense to follow in a discrete style since it is harder to distinguish lighter points laid on top of darker lines. In addition to that, in <em>ppc_interval</em>, which uses point ranges, lighter shades are used for sampled points and darker shades are used for observed points. After a bit of discussion, we decided that this is the logical way to consider the visuality of both options, as well as the fact that we are considering deprecating other rootogram styles after some time, therefore it&#8217;s not very sensible to follow their colouring convention. The final part of our discussions was whether to use the median or the mean to determine the centre point of the sampled points. In other rootogram styles, the mean is used to determine the centre, while bounds are based on the quantiles. However, this turned out to be a problematic choice in the context of a discrete style. As we have a style that visualises points discretely and distinguishes whether they lie within bounds or not, we had cases where the observed point is at 0, which is the same as the upper and lower quantiles, but the mean is at 0.04. This meant that the observed point was marked to be within the bounds despite the fact that there weren&#8217;t any visual bounds, and the observed point wasn&#8217;t on top of the centre point either. It also meant that the centre of our sampled points was out of the bounds, which didn&#8217;t make much sense either. Based on these, we decided to use the median to determine centre points. However, we didn&#8217;t touch other rootogram styles, and in the documentation and labels of plots, we made it clear that this design choice only applies to the discrete style.</p>



<p>There were lots of discussions and lots of design decisions to be taken; however, finally, the discrete rootograms are ready to be used! My work in the last two weeks, though, wasn&#8217;t limited to this. I did a bit of admin work that we discussed before to create a master issue to gather all simple, easy-to-fix issues that can be implemented by people who are new to bayesplot and open source development, which would serve as a soft entry to the world of bayesplot. Under this master issue, I gathered various small sub-issues that newcomers might want to have a look at and pick one to do their first PR: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/stan-dev/bayesplot/issues/365" rel="noreferrer noopener">Good First Issues for New Contributors</a>.</p>



<p>In the upcoming weeks, I want to focus more on residual plots. My first goal is to combine <em>ppc_scatter_error_avg</em> and <em>ppc_scatter_error_avg_vs_x</em> to reduce the number of highly similar functions. Then, I plan to move on to the implementation of long-waiting <em>ppc_residual_scatter</em>. If I have time after doing all this, I&#8217;ll probably move on to clean up some of the old issues and do some quick PRs. It has been a hectic two weeks; I wish the next two would be at least a little bit calmer. See you in the next blog post!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Hey,</p>



<p>In the <a target="_blank" href="/gsoc-diaries-4-new-arguments-and-error-plots/" rel="noreferrer noopener">last blog post</a>, I talked about the idea of working on residual plots and error plots and my decision to tackle the issue of the lack of an x argument as an optional covariate in the<em> ppc_error_binned</em> function to quickly implement something. The implementation wasn&#8217;t very complicated, and I quickly created a PR about it, which was then merged to the master branch after a small update from one of my mentors and the maintainer of the bayesplot package, Jonah. Apparently, I forgot that there was a new way that we were using to label the x-axis, which I didn&#8217;t follow, so he updated the code to follow the same way, and it was good to go. Honestly, it felt so good that there wasn&#8217;t much work needed on that PR, especially because I was planning to take a week off to travel in the Nordics with my family and some of their friends. As a result of my spending a week wandering around Copenhagen -which I absolutely loved- and Stockholm -which I didn&#8217;t really like that much- I knew I wouldn&#8217;t be able to push any new code, so that PR about <em>ppc_error_binned</em> going through smoothly upped my mood quite a bit.</p>



<p>Getting back to work last Monday after a week off, I wasn&#8217;t sure of what to do next. As I said before, second part of working with residual plots that I mentioned on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/stan-dev/bayesplot/issues/358" rel="noreferrer noopener">my issue</a>, implementing a new plot -possibly- named <em>ppc_residual</em> which would plot <em>y – stat(y_rep)</em> on the y-axis and <em>stat(y_rep)</em> on the x-axis, required careful thinking and planning about how do we want to structure error plots and residual plots so that they make the most sense to users. As this was not something that I could decide on my own, I decided to call a meeting with my mentors Jonah, Aki, and Teemu to discuss this, and then we settled on Thursday as the meeting date.</p>



<p>Since I didn&#8217;t want to sit and do nothing in the meantime, I decided to pick up another task that we put on our GitHub project and turned it into an issue: <a href="https://github.com/stan-dev/bayesplot/issues/360" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Emphasising discreteness of data in rootograms</a>. This was something that Säilynoja et al<sup data-fn="6999679c-4d69-499b-96cd-3800b4e85c5b" class="fn"><a href="#6999679c-4d69-499b-96cd-3800b4e85c5b" id="6999679c-4d69-499b-96cd-3800b4e85c5b-link">1</a></sup> proposed in <a href="https://teemusailynoja.github.io/visual-predictive-checks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their preprint</a>, which simply meant adding an alternative look to rootograms so that their discreteness is more explicit than they are at the moment. This, in my opinion, was a fair point to raise because rootograms are designed to visualise discrete data points, while the visual items in rootograms were continuous, such as lines and fields that normally represent continuity. As this issue is separate from the residual plot discussions, it seemed like a nice new avenue for me to pursue while we are deciding on the fate of residual and error plots. Unfortunately, though, it appeared to be more complicated than I thought. Adding a completely new aesthetic option to an existing graph, especially one that is a little complicated, like the proposed rootogram, takes some time to get right. I made some progress; however, at the moment, it is not good enough to create a PR about it. My first goal for the next week is to finish up that implementation quickly so that it can get merged into the main branch soon.</p>



<p>That is not all in this blog post, of course. As I told you, we had a meeting last Thursday to discuss how we want to shape error plots and residual plots and how we should group them. As they have a very similar logic behind them, it doesn&#8217;t make much sense to have different documentation pages for them. At the same time, having many functions on the same page will also lead to cluttered documentation and confuse users. Therefore, we decided to start with a fresh, blank page. We wanted to gather all functionalities that we want to have regarding error and residual plots, and then go forward. So, I created <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/stan-dev/bayesplot/issues/361" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new issue</a> to gather our and community members&#8217; ideas about these types of plots. Then, we will see which of those desired functionalities we already have implementations for and which of those need new implementations. Then, we will transfer everything to a new documentation page and make a fresh start for error and residual plots. Of course, this will take quite some time and certainly will extend beyond my GSoC time; however, I am happy that we are taking steps forward, and I&#8217;m glad that I&#8217;m a part of this journey. I would like to stay around and contribute when we do those transitions, but for now, I have to focus on other things as part of the programme. What are those going to be except rootograms? You will hear in the next blog post!</p>

<p>Hey,</p>



<p>In the <a target="_blank" href="/gsoc-diaries-3-first-pr/" rel="noreferrer noopener">last blog post</a>, I talked about quantile dot plots and doing my first official PR on the repository. Since then, that PR required a few updates and took me a couple of more days to finalise. One of my favourite things about GSoC is how much I learn about software development that I wouldn&#8217;t learn if it weren&#8217;t an open-source focused programme. For example, a small but very important thing I missed while doing my first PR was compiling the documentation. I thought writing up the documentation would be enough, but apparently, I needed to compile it explicitly so that it actually shows up on the website. After getting feedback from my mentors to fix such little mistakes, I managed to finish up the PR, and since it has been merged to the main branch, I am waiting to be included in the next release of the package. Congratulations to me, I guess!</p>



<p>As there are lots of things to implement as part of my project, I quickly started working on my next task. This time, I wanted to focus on another part of the bayesplot error/residual plots. In their paper, Säilynoja et al<sup data-fn="ce849c50-92d7-400c-bd10-1e20a0019884" class="fn"><a href="#ce849c50-92d7-400c-bd10-1e20a0019884" id="ce849c50-92d7-400c-bd10-1e20a0019884-link">1</a></sup> highlighted the importance of residual plots that are robust in visualising both continuous and discrete data. So far, error plots in bayesplot are geared towards handling continuous data, which created a need for changes.</p>



<p>There have been already talks about error plots and whether we need alternative approaches for them, so I created <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/stan-dev/bayesplot/issues/358" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new issue</a> to discuss those things, gathering two important tasks to implement: first, adding an optional <em>x</em> argument to <em>ppc_error_binned</em> function and second, implementing a new plot -possibly- named <em>ppc_residual</em> which would plot <em>y &#8211; stat(y_rep)</em> on the y-axis and <em>stat(y_rep)</em> on the x-axis. Currently, <em>ppc_error_*</em> functions are plotting stat(<em>y &#8211; y_rep)</em> on the y-axis and <em>stat(y_rep)</em> on the x-axis. Our discussion led us to think that implementing the second task requires detailed thinking, especially regarding how we want to structure the package. For example, it is an important question whether we want to create a new family of functions for <em>ppc_residual_*</em> or include them in the <em>ppc_error_*</em> family. Since we haven&#8217;t settled on this discussion, I decided to start working on something that I can implement right away: adding an optional <em>x</em> argument to <em>the ppc_error_binned</em> function.</p>



<p>To be honest, this task has been fairly easier than implementing a whole new function from scratch. As there are already helper functions to use, the task for me is just to change a handful of lines, update the documentation, and implement new tests to make sure the new abilities of the function work as intended. Though the most important part of this task was not breaking anything, because in a package that has quite a lot of users, the last thing you would want is messing with functions that people might be utilising in production code.</p>



<p>With a quick implementation phase, I managed to finish up the changes that were needed and created a <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/stan-dev/bayesplot/pull/359" rel="noreferrer noopener">new PR</a> for them. This new code is passing all the tests, not breaking any existing code, and implementing the changes we needed just as described. Hopefully, this PR will quickly make its way to the main branch. I am quite happy with ramping up my shipping speed, and I hope to keep this up. I still haven&#8217;t settled on what I should implement next, but let&#8217;s keep it as a mystery for the next diary entry!</p>

<p>Hey,</p>



<p>In the <a target="_blank" href="/gsoc-diaries-2-quantile-dot-plots/" rel="noreferrer noopener">last blog post</a>, I mentioned that I have been working on the dot plots. You know what, it was much more complicated than I anticipated. If you remember, I told you that there are two options to use under-the-hood while implementing dot plots for bayesplot, <em>geom_dotplot</em> and <em>stat_dots</em>. While the former one offers a simple solution for the feature that I was trying to implement, the latter one has more advanced capabilities at the expense of adding new dependencies to the package. I didn&#8217;t want that. I was confident that I would be able to implement what <em>stat_dots</em> offers by tweaking <em>geom_dotplot</em>. A fault confessed is half redressed. After spending a significant amount of time implementing auto-sizing dots and stack ratio of dot plots by finding the number of the tallest line, I realised that I would need more work than just tweaking the <em>geom_dotplot</em>. I would need to implement a whole new <em>geom</em> and simply build what <em>stat_dots</em> offers from scratch. After consulting with Jonah, Aki, and Teemu, I have decided that using <em>stat_dots</em> is the better way to go.</p>



<p>We didn&#8217;t want to hard-introduce <em>ggdist</em> and instead, we added it as a suggested dependency to the package. On top of that, we added a check to the newly implemented <em>ppc_qdotplot</em> and <em>ppd_qdotplot</em> to see whether <em>ggdist</em> is implemented or not. The rest was relatively straightforward. By following similar functions that were already implemented, such as <em>ppc_hist</em>, I built <em>ppc_qdotplot</em> and <em>ppd_qdotplot</em>. They simply are functions that take inputs of Bayesian methods, format them nicely and turn them into graphs by passing them to the<em> stat_dots</em> function.</p>



<p>However, there is more to open-source software development than just implementing the functions. It needs to have detailed documentation as well as a sensible testing structure. I started with documentation simply because it was easier to do. Since bayesplot uses <em>roxygen</em> to create its documentation, I had to follow a certain structure while creating documentation. By following the existing documentation, I explained the new functions in detail and also created an example to showcase how it works. I also created tests for new functions. Bayesplot utilises the <em>testthat</em> library to build unit tests and has two main types of tests: the first one is to test that functions return correct types for different argument combinations, and the second type is to test whether the outputs of functions have changed since the last time that tests are run. To the second one, graphs are saved as SVG files, and they are compared with the outputs of the next test run. The only issue with this structure is that sometimes SVG files change without any visible change to graphics, which leads to false negatives. To implement these tests for <em>ppc_qdotplot</em> and <em>ppd_qdotplot</em>, I have followed the existing examples. The only addition I had was wrapping some of the test functions with <em>expect_warning</em>. This was because sometimes when dots don&#8217;t fit the graph, <em>stat_dots</em> throws an error, which is not subject to our unit tests and can be ignored in this context. While doing that, I have allowed those unit tests to ignore those warning messages.</p>



<p>All of these things that I have explained simply constitute the basis of my first PR to the bayesplot library. PR is still pending to be merged, and I will fix any issues based on the feedback of my mentors. I am happy with my work so far, and I feel like I am learning quite a lot, not just in terms of technical skills but also about general procedures of software development. If everything goes well with this function, my next plan is to work on discrete residual plots. Hope to explain that part in the next blog post!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Hey,<br>It has been two weeks since I wrote the previous journal entry, which was aimed at concluding the community bonding period and starting the coding period. The coding period has been underway since the beginning of this month, and I wanted to give an update about my progress so far, as I promised.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll start by confessing one thing: the coding period has started fairly slowly for me. Unfortunately, my final exams -which I had 3 of them- spanned from June 2 to June 6, pretty much blocking my chances to do any significant coding for that week. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, though, I have done stuff. We already had a GitHub project as our project management tab, and I spent my free time looking at the task items there, organising and editing them.</p>



<p>Things took off more in the second week, though. When I got freed from the school work, I had so much time to dedicate to Google Summer of Code, which I happily did. We had an initial meeting to discuss which task item I should start working on, and decided that quantile dot plots are the best option, as we anticipated that they should be rather similar in implementation compared to other graphing options we have, such as histograms or density plots. To implement this, I had two options to choose from:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>ggplot2::geom_dotplot()</li>



<li>ggdist:stat_dots()</li>
</ul>



<p>Just by looking at those functions, it was clear that <em>ggdist::stat_dots()</em> is simply the superior function when it comes to plotting dots on Cartesian axes, since it gives the option to plot only certain quantiles of the data. Even though it was dependent on the <em>ggplot::geom_dotplot()</em>, it has some very remarkable upgrades and a few extra customisation opportunities over the bare <em>ggplot::geom_dotplot()</em> function, which was the second option.</p>



<p>However, software development is never just about picking the most advanced method. If the more basic method is enough for the purposes of the project, then it&#8217;s likely to be a better fit since advanced capabilities often come with extra maintenance tasks. Therefore, I decided to examine both of the functions well enough and made my decision in an informed way.</p>



<p>This is not the only thing we discussed in the meeting, of course. We also discussed a lot about the testing of newly implemented functions. Testing functions that return visual objects is slightly different from testing functions that return easily comparable items. For that reason, bayesplot has a testing approach that saves the image files and compares them to see what the changes are from the previous version of the function to the next version. Bayesplot doesn&#8217;t employ a strict test-driven development; however, it was among the topics that we discussed. We also agreed about some practicalities and made sure how we want to run things moving forward, such as me being responsible for calling the meetings when I need them and Teemu being the first responsible for the project.</p>



<p>The first two weeks weren&#8217;t as productive as I would have wished due to school and exams; however, I am happy with the progress I have made, especially in the last week. In the next two weeks, my goal is to dedicate most of my time to implementing the dot plot function with proper testing and documentation.</p>



<p>See you in the next entry of GSoC diaries!</p>

<p>Hey,</p>



<p>One of the things that I became aware of when I was contacted by Aki to see if I am still interested in working on bayesplot as part of Google Summer of Code was that I needed to write regular diaries to document my journey. As I always think a little too much when it comes to how polished things look and how well they are organised, I decided to overhaul my personal website so that I can host a blog on it, which I will be writing biweekly starting from today. After working on it to find a good-looking template and make sure everything looks clean, I can finally start my Google Summer of Code journey with my first diary entry!</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading has-heading-5-font-size">My Journey</h5>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Before writing this entry, I searched online to see what kind of diary entries people wrote and what they mentioned to get some inspiration. For many people, it seems like the journey was about searching through hundreds of different organisations and tons of different projects to find the best one and then spending hours preparing multiple proposals and finally receiving the good news: getting in. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I also spent some good hours preparing my proposal, and I really put thought into the project; however, it didn&#8217;t start in the same way for me that it did for many other people.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I heard about GSoC a couple of months ago, when I was still looking for a summer internship. I was thinking of applying to the JetBrains internship programme, and since they had many different positions open, I was looking at the mentors as well. There, I saw that a project mentor had an experience with GSoC when he was still a student. That caught my eye, and I added GSoC to my job applications sheet. As the deadline for GSoC approached, I still didn&#8217;t have a summer internship, so I decided to take a look at the projects offered here. Hovering around on the website, I came across many interesting projects that I would be happy to be part of. I also saw NumFocus, an umbrella organisation for many open source software projects, including the one that I am now part of, Stan.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I first encountered Stan in Autumn 2024, when I started my master&#8217;s in machine learning at Aalto University and took Bayesian Data Analysis from Aki Vehtari. There, we were asked to use Stan in course assignments and the course project, which I quite enjoyed. I enjoyed it so much that I will be a teaching assistant there for the 2025 iteration. Since Aki and some of the course staff are also contributors to Stan, the instructions on Stan were pretty useful, and I genuinely enjoyed using it. So, when I met with Aki to discuss being a teaching assistant for his course, I also asked about GSoC. That was the point where things actually took off for me. I had only a day and a half left to apply, and by spending as much time as possible on the proposal, getting very useful help from Aki and lacking sleep for a day, I managed to put together a well-prepared proposal. After that, it was time to wait…</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">May 8 came when I was in Turkey, having an extended spring break that I planned, hoping I would get a summer internship. When I booked tickets and made my plans to have that break, I was quite hopeful that I would have something for the summer, but when May 8 came, I had nothing on my hands. I got rejected by more than 100 positions that I applied for at different stages, sometimes after multiple tests and interviews, sometimes without even talking to anyone. GSoC was the only position left unanswered yet. With those thoughts in my mind, I opened the email from Google:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Thank you for applying to be a Google Summer of Code 2025 contributor.</p>



<p>Unfortunately your proposal with NumFOCUS was not accepted. Every year we receive more contributor proposals than we are able to accept. We hope you will apply again in the future.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>To be honest, I was disappointed. I thought I had a good proposal, and I had prior experience with Stan, so I was thinking it was fairly logical that I would get picked for this. The reality was different, however. The project instead went to Teemu, who now helps me. I thank him so much! When I saw that, it made sense, to be fair. He had a published paper about bayesplot; of course, he was more qualified than I was. With that, I started to get used to the idea of not having anything set for the summer, and instead, I would be working on my personal projects. That lasted only a few days, until I got an email from Aki:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Hi Behram,<br><br>I guess you have noticed that GSoC did not fund you. We did get 2/3 proposals funded. However, if you are still interested, there might still be a chance. One student, who was selected, would like to drop out, and it might be possible to switch the project to you. Are you still interested?</p>



<p>Aki</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I was so interested! I didn&#8217;t have anything set for the summer, and I really enjoyed working with Stan, so I got extremely excited. I and Aki I had a quick call where he explained to me the situation, and we agreed to wait for the response from Google. As Google came out positive about the decisions a couple of days later, my GSoC journey officially began! I am so excited to be part of the Stan team and contribute to the development of bayesplot. It feels fascinating that I am part of the development of a software package that I was a user of a couple of months ago for my course project. I hope I can achieve all of my goals and have a very good journey with Stan, which doesn&#8217;t last with GSoC!</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">My Project</h5>



<p>The bayesplot package is a popular tool for visualising Bayesian analysis results in R. As part of the Stan ecosystem, it helps researchers understand their statistical models through clear graphics.<sup data-fn="451fa8c2-1782-4c74-bc71-3bb483d9a48f" class="fn"><a href="#451fa8c2-1782-4c74-bc71-3bb483d9a48f" id="451fa8c2-1782-4c74-bc71-3bb483d9a48f-link">1</a></sup> This project will make the package even more useful by adding new visualisations, particularly for predictive checks of discrete and categorical outcomes. I&#8217;ll focus on creating intuitive plots that help users check if their models match real-world observations. Another important goal is improving documentation to make the package easier for newcomers to use and contribute to. These updates will help users of the Stan framework to get their results in more easily presentable forms with new graphics and visuals. This, in addition to simple documentation, will help bayesplot continue serving the growing Bayesian community effectively.</p>



<p>Building upon the existing robust framework of bayesplot, the project will primarily focus on implementing the recommendations outlined in &#8220;Recommendations for visual predictive checks in Bayesian workflow&#8221; by Säilynoja et al.<sup data-fn="482e1842-61a7-4c8b-a7c1-d3ceda54c00a" class="fn"><a href="#482e1842-61a7-4c8b-a7c1-d3ceda54c00a" id="482e1842-61a7-4c8b-a7c1-d3ceda54c00a-link">2</a></sup> Here are list of visualisations that will be aimed at adding to the bayesplot library:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Quantile dot plot: </strong>The quantile dot plot is a dot plot where a set number of the observed quantiles is visualised instead of the observations themselves. It visualises the distribution of a variable by plotting dots at specific quantiles of the data. It is not included in the bayesplot, however, as it is part of the ggplot2 library with the function <em>geom_dotplot</em>, it can be implemented for the bayesplot library as well.</li>



<li><strong>Binned calibration plots: </strong>In these binned calibration plots, the binary observations are divided into a predetermined number of uniform bins, based on the event probabilities predicted by the model. Comparing the mean predicted probability to the observed event rate within each bin allows assessing the calibration, or reliability, of the model. At the moment, bayesplot doesn&#8217;t have a function to create binned calibration plots. However, it can be implemented by using ggplot functionalities.</li>



<li><strong>PAV-adjusted calibration plots: </strong>This is a more advanced calibration plot where the observed proportions are smoothed via isotonic regression (PAV algorithm) to visualise monotonic miscalibration. It is not included in the bayesplot at the moment. Though it can be implemented by using reliabilitydiag and ggplot2 libraries.</li>



<li><strong>Residual plots: </strong>Even though bayesplot offers residual plots through its <em>ppc_error_*</em> group of functions, those functions are more geared towards continuous data with styles like scattering. It is possible to improve that group of functions to handle discrete and categorical information better and create plots for a wider range of data types. This is possible by using combinations of ggplot2 functions.</li>



<li><strong>Bounded KDE plots:</strong> When the observation density is smooth and unbounded, visualisations aimed at continuous distributions are used, and data is generally represented correctly. However, when the visualisations do not meet the assumptions regarding the observation distribution, the situation gets problematic. That applies when bounded data is tried to be visualised by KDEs. Currently, bayesplot provides functions to visualise with KDEs, such as <em>ppc_dens_*</em>. However, those functions don&#8217;t handle alternative cases really well. Instead, it would be better to implement functions in bayesplot that take care of the bounded data with correct boundary corrections methods.</li>



<li><strong>Rootograms: </strong>bayesplot offers its own <em>ppc_rootogram </em>function to plot rootograms. However, there is a need for an upgrade for better visuals and putting more emphasis on the discreteness of the data. There is a proposed visualisation by Säilynoja et al, which can be implemented for bayesplot as well. With this update on bayesplot, rootograms would be better suited for the purposes.</li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Community Bonding Period</h5>



<p>During the community bonding period, I was still in Turkey, so our meetings happened online in general. I already met with Aki multiple times before, but during this period, I had a chance to meet with other mentors of the project, Johah, Noa, and Teemu, who moved from being contributors to mentoring me in the project. We had a meeting to simply get to know each other, but also to discuss our goals and plans. I was also instructed about the workflow that is used to contribute to Stan. Given full access to the bayesplot repository, I was able to contribute to the project more easily and with less hassle. Apart from meetings, I dug deeper into the codebase during this period to have a better view of the repository and design my roadmap in a more detailed way. Teemu created a GitHub project which will work as a project management tab during the GSoC period, and we agreed to use GitHub issues to discuss items on our roadmap in a more detailed way. With everything set and agreed on, I am now ready to work on bayesplot and enjoy my time at GSoC.</p>



<p>See you in the next entry of GSoC diaries!</p>
